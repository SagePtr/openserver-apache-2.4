  DIRECTIVES REFERENCE

  NTLMAuth: set to 'on' to activate NTLM authentication here

  NTLMAuthoritative: set to 'off' to allow access control to be passed along to 
                     lower modules if the UserID is not known to this module

  NTLMBasicPreferred: set to 'on' if you want basic authentication to be the higher 
                      priority

  NTLMChainAuth: set to 'on' if you want an alternative authorization module like 
                 SVNPathAuthz to work at the same level

  NTLMDomain: set to the domain you want users authenticated against for cleartext 
              authentication - if not specified, the local machine, then all trusted

  NTLMMSIE3Hack: set to 'on' if you expect MSIE 3 clients to be using this server

  NTLMOfferBasic: set to 'on' to allow the client to authenticate against NT with 
                  'Basic' authentication instead of using the NTLM protocol

  NTLMOfferNTLM: set to 'off' to allow access control to be passed along to lower 
                 modules if the UserID is not known to this module

  NTLMOmitDomain: set to 'on' if you want the usernames to have the domain prefix 
                  OMITTED, on = user, off = DOMAIN\user
