     [Eric Covener]

  *) Windows: "graceful kill fail, sending SIGKILL" log message is now

     assignments).  PR 51657  [William Rowe]

  *) Conform script response parsing with mod_cgid and ensure no response
     body is sent when ap_meets_conditions() determines that request
     conditions are met.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Improve logging in access control hook functions.  [Chris Darroch]

  *) Avoid making internal sub-requests and processing Location headers
     when in FCGI_AUTHORIZER mode, as the auth hook functions already
     treat Location headers returned by scripts as an error since
     redirections are not meaningful in this mode.  [Chris Darroch]
     
Changes with mod_fcgid 2.3.7

  *) Introduce FcgidWin32PreventOrphans directive on Windows to use OS
     Job Control Objects to terminate all running fcgi's when the worker
     process has been abruptly terminated. PR: 51078
     [Thangaraj AntonyCrouse <thangaraj gmail.com>]

     forcefully killed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Correct a problem that resulted in FcgidMaxProcesses being ignored
     in some situations.  PR 48981.  [<rkosolapov gmail.com>]

  *) Fix the search for processes with the proper vhost config when
     ServerName isn't set in every vhost or a module updates 
     r->server->server_hostname dynamically (e.g., mod_vhost_cdb)
     or a module updates r->server dynamically (e.g., mod_vhost_ldap).
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) FcgidPassHeader now maps header names to environment variable names
     in the usual manner: The header name is converted to upper case and
     is prefixed with HTTP_.  An additional environment variable is 
     created with the legacy name.  PR 48964.  [Jeff Trawick]

     ownership of mutex files was incorrect, resulting in a startup failure.
     PR 48651.  [Jeff Trawick, <pservit gmail.com>]

  *) Return 500 instead of segfaulting when the application returns no output.
     [Tatsuki Sugiura <sugi nemui.org>, Jeff Trawick]

     as OS X in its default configuration.  This is a regression since mod_fcgid
     2.2.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Recover from most "Resource temporarily unavailable" errors writing the
     request to the FastCGI application.  These were common with large request
     bodies on Mac OS X and intermittent on Solaris.  PR 48025.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix a bug in fixconf.sed that resulted in a prefix of "FcgidFcgid" on the
     updated directives.  [Dan Hulme <dhulme gmail.com>]

  *) Fix possible corruption or truncation of request bodies which exceed
     FcgidMaxRequestInMem.  This is a regression since mod_fcgid 2.2, which

     which were defined with command-line arguments on the FcgidWrapper
     directive.  [Jeff Trawick]

     [Paul Howarth <paul city-fan.org>]

  *) Fix a mod_fcgid 2.3.1 failure with <sys/mutex.h> when building for
     httpd 2.0.x on some platforms.  [Paul Howarth <paul city-fan.org>]

  *) Termination of idle processes after inactivity timeout can now be 
     disabled by setting FcgidIdleTimeout to 0.  Termination of idle 
     processes based on the process lifetime can now be disabled by setting
     FcgidProcessLifeTime to 0.  FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess now accepts 0
     for unlimited.  [Ricardo Cantu <ricardo smartcsc.com>]

  *) All directives have been renamed in order to use a common prefix "Fcgid".
     Underscores in directive names have been eliminated in favor of
     CamelCase. The old directive names will still work but are deprecated.
     To fix your configuration you can use the sed script build/fixconf.sed.
     The following tables contains old and new directive names.

  *) Separate classes by virtual host also on Windows.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) Log client IP address with many more error log messages.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix basic implementation of FcgidMaxRequestInMem and FcgidMaxRequestLen
     directives.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Merge per-directory directives so that they can be inherited or
     overridden within other containers as expected.  Merge server config/
     virtual host directives so that they can be inherited or overridden
     within a virtual host as expected. [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Use the virtual host settings for the request being processed instead
     of those of the first FastCGI request handled by this httpd child process.
     Affected directives: FcgidBusyTimeout, FcgidIOTimeout,
     FcgidConnectTimeout, FcgidMaxRequestsPerProcess, and FcgidOutputBufferSize.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Directives which previously were ignored in a virtual host context are no
     longer allowed.  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Add an optional flag "virtual" to FcgidWrapper.
     If virtual is set, the URLs passed to the wrapper are not
     checked, whether they resolve to a file.  [Rainer Jung]

  *) Make the second argument (suffix) for FcgidWrapper optional.
     A wrapper defined without a suffix applies to all URLs, unless
     there is another more specific wrapper with a suffix.  [Rainer Jung]

Changes with mod_fcgid 2.3.1

  *) Suppress "need AuthType to note auth failure" error-level messages when a
     FastCGIAccessChecker fails without any other kind of authentication 
     (Basic, Digest) configured.  [Eric Covener]
  
  *) Complete the unix port to 2.3-dev trunk.  [William Rowe]

  *) Provide a default, mandatory environment as with mod_cgi (with the
     inclusion of LD_LIBRARY_PATH or similar variables on other platforms),
     unless overridden by DefaultInitEnv.  [William Rowe]

  *) Handle DefaultInitEnv for case-insensitive platforms by forcing the env
     variable names to uppercase on Win32, OS2 and Netware.  [William Rowe]

  *) Don't try to set the ownership of the socket directory unless running
     as root and the directory was just created.  This allows the default
     httpd.conf (with some daemon User/Group) to be used by non-root.
     [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix formatting of several messages, including the oft-seen "mod_fcgid: 
     Can't create shared memory for size %zu byte".  [Jeff Trawick]

  *) Fix declared names of FastCgiAuthenticator and FastCgiAuthenticator-
     Authoritative directives, allowing them to be used.  [Ulf Haueisen
     <ulf dvlp.de>]

  *) Fix vhost-specific DefaultInitEnv settings.  Previously, when setting 
     multiple virtual hosts with the same SuexecUserGroup user and group, the
     process manager use the same process pool for both virtual hosts. This 
     means if one virtual host has a DefaultInitEnv and the other has 
     different values set, a fastcgi request from any of these virtual host
     can go to the same processes, which is inconsistent (a request from 
     virtualhost a with DefaultInitEnv VAL "a", can go to a process spawned 
     with virtualhost b with DefaultInitEnv VAL "b" set).  [Gabriel Barazer
